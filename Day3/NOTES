sir what is the diff btween logical and bitwise operators?

sir we compulsory have to remember these all vaLUES = NO




tilde operator == its reverse for 0 and 1 but how for other values


tilde operator is reverse for 0 and 1

tilde operator will not work for decimal numbers 


Binary : 0 , 1

Step 1: Decimal : 4 
Step 2: Decimal got converted in to binary  [Binary for 4 is : 0000000000000100]
Step 3: tilde applied for binary not decimal [~(0000000000000100)]
Step 4: 1111111111111011 
Step 5: Binary to decimal conversion 
Step 6: Decimal number as final output

0000000000000100 = 4
1111111111111011 = -5
