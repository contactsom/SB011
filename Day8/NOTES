1. STUDENT : Sir i want to develop my LMS as per this SRS.
2. GUIDE   : I want LMS to be developed as per this SRS only. 
	
	
public interface Employee {

	public void getCourseName();
	public void getEmployeeName();
	public abstract void getEmployeeAge();

}

OR

public interface Employee {

	 void getCourseName();
	 void getEmployeeName();
	 void getEmployeeAge();

}
