sir to fetch data from vector we can only use enumerartion as a cursor? YES

Cursor :
	Enumeration- Vector
	Iterator
	List iterator
	
	
	foreach loop will not work for linked list like arraylist?? It worked
	what is the differencew between arraylist and linkedlist?
	
	sir when we use list iterator we give object as iterstor only..why?
	
	real time scenario how we will know when to use different collections??
	
	
Linked List :
	1. Insertion order Preserved 
	2. Duplicate object Allowed
	3. Null value is possible 
	4. This is good for insertion and deletion operation
	5. Worst choice for retriving the element.
	
	
	
Set (I) :
	1. It allowed duplicate element	

HashSet :
	1. It not allowed duplicate element	
	2. Insertion order not preserved,.
	3. null value allowed [only once]
	
	
	
	
	*******************************
	
	
if we want only 3 and Farhin then is there a way to get it directly rather than iterating
